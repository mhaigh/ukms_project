Project overview
-----------------

This mini project aims to develop an understanding of the spatial dependence of weather predicatability in the UK region. The idea is to decompose the area of the UK into "superpixels", each containing a relatively homogeneous area with respect to some meteorological property. Statistical techniques are then applied on the set of superpixels (superpixel-mean MOGREPS data) in order to understand what determines unpredictability in and around the UK.
